# Prompts Repository

A collection of curated prompts organized for reuse, experimentation, and sharing.
This repository serves as a reference and toolkit for building with prompts in different contexts (coding, writing, pull request descriptions, study guides, professional application messages, brainstorming, or AI-assisted workflows).

## 📌 Best Practices

- Keep prompts atomic (one clear task or idea per prompt)
- Use placeholders where customization is expected
- Add context when necessary but avoid overloading with details
- Prefer Markdown format for readability
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `debugging-react.md`)
- Keep prompts **clear, concise, and reusable**
- Submit a pull request with a short description of your addition
